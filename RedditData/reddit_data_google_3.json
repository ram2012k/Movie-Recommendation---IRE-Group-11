My favorite idea that I've heard is have it twist into a dark psychological thriller where after Aurora finds out that Jim woke her up, she stalks him through the spaceship and then kills him. Then we'd get to see her succumbing to loneliness herself gradually coming to understand why Jim woke her up. The film could end with her preparing to open another pod to start the cycle over again.

There isn't really much about time-travel but I think it fits nicely into this kind of game and the performances by the 2 main actors are brilliantly executed.\n\n**Looper** is a nice time-travel movie with some nice action.\n\n**12 Monkeys** is a nice movie and TV-series, can't go wrong with either one.\n\n**Safety not guaranteed** is one of the sweetest movies of recent years and it explores the possibilities of believing in time-travel. It‚Äôs not for everyone - people who dont like dreams - but its worth a try!\n\n**Predestination** is probably one of the best movie I saw last year and it's basically a better edition of Looper :P\n\n**INCEPTION** of course! This is more about the psychological parts of LIS and your state of mind. If you surprisingly haven't seen Inception then that is your duty before the next episode\n\n**Whip it** is a great example of friendshio. Main protagonist being the flawless Ellen Page who loves to do something her parents aren't really proud of. It includes lots of recognition of taking chouces by yourself and deciding for yourself on what you want to do.\n\nDozens upon dozens of indie movies that you can find that doesn't necessarily tackle time-travel will all feel relevant because Life is Strange is basically a good freaking indie movie with the difference that its a game!\n\nThere will be a TV-show thread but just a taste - **Fringe, Twin Peaks and the X-Files** would top that thread for me, PERIOD!\n", "The game itself includes a reference to **Primer**, which is a time travel movie that's absurdly unforgiving and complicated.

And I would say **The Edge of Tomorrow** for time rewind and inclusion of a strong female main character.\n\n ", "**Lost and delirious** I think I've seen this mentioned in conjunction with LiS somewhere but having just rewatched it, there are quite a few similarities. It's set in a boarding school but one that is aesthetically similar to Blackwell, features a character sorta like Chloe (Angry, impulsive, rebellious, lesbian, writes shit on her walls, habitually smokes weed etc) A character a bit like Max (mouse), there's even a scene where they discuss Macbeth and how Lady Macbeth wishes to become more like a man so she can do what she needs to do without being held back by softer feminine instincts.

I half expected it to be cheesy, mindless background noise when I first watched it, but I was SO wrong.  It's philosophical, entertaining, and the characters have a similar feel to those of LIS in that they're so easy to get attached to.

It's a good movie, it may be a bit slow-paced, but the atmosphere and psycological terror it creates it's quite interesting.\n\n- Grave Encounters (2011): Great concept and setting, it gets to be quite unsettling and scary if you like. But in my opinion, it's way too revealing, which is something I don't enjoy in this kind of movies.

It's not 100% found footage, but it blends it with studio footage and the result is pretty interesting, at least for me.\n\n- The Tunnel (2012): Pretty good movie I have to say, the setting is quite disturbing and mysterious, and the whole execution of the concept was really well done.\n\n- REC (2007): One of the best in the genre by far, there's an American version called Quarantine, but I haven't seen, nor have the intention to do so.\n\nP/S: Stay away from VHS 3, please don't do that to yourself.

Even though that move was purposely made that way. At least with r/tifu you will have actual good comedy sketches. ", "Am I too late? Can I still post here? :D I have a few ideas, that've been sticking in my mind forever.\n\n1. **The Litigator.** A man is pulled over by a police officer for breaking the speed limit. The man, accompanied by a friend, is cordial with the officer. Officer request licence, insurance, and registration. Nothing wrong, just technical questions. The man behind the wheel asks the officer a few technical questions, very gently and cordially. The cop dismisses the questions and answers without thinking. The man signs the citation for the ticket, the officers leave, and both men leave. Both men wish the cop a nice day. In the next scene, the cop receives a knock by the local sheriff, he is summoned in court and being sued by the man be pulled over. The cop violated a few laws. The man and his partner are very well versed lawyers from prestigious law schools, they literally extortion and are a living hell for police officers. Very suave lawyers & with good networks & connections. They come visit the officer at his jail cell and offer to listen to him. THe wife threatens to leave the officer with his kid, and the media paints the officer bad along with his police department. These suave lawyers know how to sell a story to the media. The lawyers are a living hell to police officers. At the end of the movie/trial, the officer is administratively suspended without pay and the police department must pay a lump sum in damages to the lawyers. A few weeks later, the cop is then summoned again to court. We don't know why and we won't know why. But most likely, by knowing the characters, the suit is probably bogus but the cop has no chance. Most likely the police department will enter a plea deal. The lawyers prey on small police departments and unsavvy & untrained hard-working officers. This movie fits our currrent time with all these police brutality and shit. It will show officers as hard workers & maybe give them sympathy.\n\n2. **The Intern.** (based on a true story). Kevin, works from home, he owns an e-commerce business. He receives a phone call from a high school buddy. His buddy, Lance, works in Wall St.. They shot the shit, catch up and all that. Lance tells Kevin there's a summer internship at the firm and could use someone like him. Kevin thinks about it and says why not. Its' time to get out of home and do something differnt. Kevin flies to NYC and hits it off with Lance. Lance gets him a suited well-tailored suit and few supplies to be the best intern ever. Kevin is pretty elated and likes this work. Kevin considers a career in finance and he's building a good network easily. 3 months later, the firm is raided by the FBI & SEC. Embezzlement, cooking of the books and few other white collar crimes are pinned on the intern, Kevin. After all, he had access to highly sensitive data. While financial transactions require much bureaucratic approval, changes in information systems do not, which is why there is strong suspiscion Kevin is guilty. Lance becomes cold. Kevin calls his father, at the deathbed and explains the situation. His father tells him to visit an old buddy of his. Kevin pays a visit to his father's buddy. It's retired lawyer, and he's grumpy and done defending young crooks. Kevin is very passionate and trial is 30 days.\n\n*\"Mr. Campbell, my father, Ken, sent me here. I know you're retired. Please here me out. I'm facing 20 years behind bars for white collar crimes. Whether found guilty or not guilty, you will never see me again. All I ask is for 30 days. Give me 30 days. I do not want you to be my lawyer. I want you to teach me to be a laywer in 30 days.\"*\n\nI can go way further, but it's too much. It's a setup & a double-cross by Lance. Kevin is found not guilty but his father passes shortly before his announcement. Kevin \"grows\" and Mr. Campbell takes him in. \n(Half of this is based in my life, really).\n\nShortly after this blows over, Kevin tells him friend to give him a ride to company. His friend, Robert, asks what its for. Kevin is going to an interview to a company. The company offers a 50 %pension after 20 years, free healthcare, free food and housing, and has excellent upward mobility. Robert drops him off at a small building, next to a strip mall. Its an Armed Forces Career Center. Kevin decided to drop everything and pursue greater things in life. He will join the military. Robert wishes him the best.  \nRobert works for a boutique firm in wall street. He was in the Marine Corps and met Kevin during a small networking event. Kevin asked Lance, \"Who are those guys?\" Lance said they were veterans. Kevin had a hard time getting business with them, since they are their own clique (that's pretty true today). Kevin built small rapport with Robert. Robert offered some support to Kevin during his hard times. Robert told his story of overcoming barriers and fear during his time in Afghanistan. Kevin looked up to Robert somewhat and he had that \"je ne sais quoi\". Kevin would never know but he wanted it. He joined the Army and shortly deployed after training. At the end of the movie, we see Kevin out in Iraq/middle east. He encounters a fellow vet from that small networking event. Jack does double-take at Kevin. Jack remember seeing Kevin in the news, facing trial but was found not guilty in the end. Jack is an Army Guardsmen, currently deployed, but another wallstreeter like Robert. Kevin sees him, confidently, and nods him at. Jack smirks, and nods slowly. Kevin is now a grown man. They understand each other. The end.\n\n3. **The Lieutenant.** We've heard stories of civillians who did what they could to smuggle jews and prisoners out of the hands of nazi's gruesome camps. However, we never hear about the few officers who helped jews escape death. This is a story of young buy who lived out in the middle of nowhere Germany and earned his commission as the Lieutenant in the Germany Army. He is bright-eyed and motivated. However, as war progresses, he becomes jaded, heart-broken and very sorrow for the grim future of the jews. He forges paperwork, derails scheduled train rides, and uses his rank to order Soldiers to go away so he can save any life. A woman catches him and has a suspiscion. They fall in love, and she believes in his cause. She never betrays him or rats him out. They envision a life together after the war, away from the war. They're young, in love, and just want to be away. They build very close romance. Right before the war ends, she dies in an explosion inside a building. He goes to the frontlines, with the enlisted and fights for 2 fiersome days. It's brutal. He almost dies. But he lost his most loved one, so he \"lost it all\". During the movie, we see him wake up in cold sweat. He turns and tosses. He suffers from PTSD. After the war, he suffers from PTSD. However, he finds closure. He visits an old town/village. A family lives there. A young girl remembers him, as the man that saved them. The Lieutenant ordered the Soldiers, as per the (forged) paperwork, that these Jews are to be sent to another city (without a concentration camp). The ex-Lieutenant sees what his efforts did. The village grew, thanks to him, and his wife always believed he would make a difference. It ends very sweet. The lieutenant never received a medal for his effort or a promotion, but he saw fruits of his sacrifice. While he didn't have family of his own, he liberated many families.\n\n\nSome of these ideas are based on my life. I get very passionate about it.

I love some slasher franchises like Nightmare on Elm, Scream, Saw, and Halloween. I've tried getting into the Friday the 13th but never did. Never got into Texas Chainsaw. I think the paranormal activity movies are over-the-top bad movies. \nI feel like every time I look for a scary movie to watch, when I look up the trailer or it's rating on imdb i instantly get disinterested, which is totally lame because I know I shouldn't judge an entire movie based on a trailer or it's public rating. \nI tend to like the psychological thrillers more than anything if that gives you an idea of what I'm looking for.

'The Invitation' is also psychological and entertaining. ", "oh man, I just posted a list of my faves in another sub. I'll copy it here for you!\n  \n  \n*Trick R Treat* and *Trick R Treat 2* are two good Halloween-themed movies. I like one better than the other, but I forgot which one now..  \n  \n*ABCs of Death* There are a few. I recommend them all. Each movie is 26 short films by horror writers/directors from around the world. Each person got a letter and had to create a short using a word that starts with that letter as inspiration. It's a lot of fun to guess the word since they don't show it until the end of the short. (and don't look them up beforehand!! that's no fun!) Also I kind of need to just put a warning on this one... some of the shorts have really disturbing things, even for horror (Pedo and animal abuse are definitely the worst, and they're only in two shorts)\n  \n*Pontypool*. More weird than traditional spooky horror, but very good.  \n  \n*The Invitation*. Like Pontypool, it's not traditional spooky horror, but it's one of my faves.\n  \n*What we do in the Shadows* is another fave, but it's horror comedy. 100% worth the watch even though it isn't scary. (And the first time I watched it I didn't know it wasn't \"real\" horror going into it! It was certainly a surprise!)\n  \n*Event Horizon*. Sci-fi horror!\n  \n*Grave Encounters*. Ghost hunter show/documentary spoof-based horror. Very good. Don't let the first bit fool you into thinking it's just a shitty ghost hunter show.\n  \nI'm also a huge fan of supernatural/demonic haunting movies, and especially found footage style (as long as it's not shaky cam!) so I'll also suggest: *The Conjuring*, *Paranormal Activity* (1-3 are pretty good, 4 is cheesy, 5 is bad, and I highly recommend *The Marked Ones* which is a spin-off that features a stereotypical latino kids. Pretty ridiculous), *The Awakening*, *Insidious*, *Oculus* \n  \nI'm sure there are more that I love, but I can't remember now... ", "I'd recommend Julia's Eyes.

No maximum.)\n\nPlayer one comes up with the name of an actor or actress but keeps it in his head.\nPlayer two does the same.\nOn the count of three, both players call out the actor or actress they thought of.\nNow, all players begin to think of links between the two actors in six-degrees or less. The first person to answer wins. \nthe 'links' will go something like this. Try to connect Bruce Willis to Adam Sandler: (1) Bruce Willis was in Fifth Element with Chris Tucker. (2) Chris Tucker was in Rush Hour with Jackie Chan. (3) Jackie Chan was in Canonball Run with Burt Reynolds. (4) Burt Reynolds was in The Longest Yard with Adam Sandler.\n\n\"The Movie Game\"\n(Two or more players. Even number of players might require special consideration, see below.)\n\nPlayer one comes up with an actor or actress.\nPlayer two must come up with a movie in which that actor or actress was cast.\nPlayer three comes up with an actor or actress that was in the movie named by player two.\nContinue the pattern.\nIf you lose three times, you are out.\nA player who is stuck can 'challenge' the previous player. That previous player must be able to come up with an answer that the challenger could have said. If not, the player who got challenged loses. (for example, Player One says \"Malcolm McDowell\", player two says \"Cat People\" and player three can't think of another actor who was in Cat People. Player Three then challenges player two. Player Two can't remember another actor or actress in Cat People, so Player Two loses. (A correct answer would have been Natassja Kinski.)\nIn a situation where there are an even number of players, the same players will keep on having to come up with an actor or a movie, turn after turn. In this case, after each round, you can alternate the roles.\n\n\nDo any of you have some good alternatives or variations to these games?\nThanks!\n", ["I forgot where I heard about it, but the IMDB game is pretty fun and more accessible for those who can't hang with Six Degrees. You just need the IMDB app for iphone. You look up an actor and in their profile it lists 4 notable movies they've been in. The game is simple, you just try an guess these 4 movies. What makes it challenging is figuring out which movies are the most \"notable\" for that particular actor according to IMDB. Their most financially successful movie? Their first role? Their most controversial role? Their small role in major award winner? Who knows. For example, I'd get 5 guesses to pick the 4 movies for Tom Hanks. I'd probably guess Big, Da Vinci Code, Cast Away, and Forrest Gump as the most notable over the course of his career. Looking it up now though I see it is Da Vinci Code, Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, and The Green Mile. I personally thought his role in the Green Mile was a bit forgettable, but such is the IMDB game. There's no understanding their metric for picking these 4 movies which makes for an even playing field.", "I was always a fan of the name as many movies for a specific actor/actress. Simple, effective, fun.", "Doug Benson on his podcast Doug Loves Movies plays a number of movie games you may be interested in.\n\n For example he plays a game called 'A,B,C, Deez Nuts' in which you just go through the alphabet alternating between players who must name a movie that starts with that letter. If you can't name a movie you're out. Another game he plays is 'Last Man Stanton' in which you choose a person in the film industry and then go back and forth trying to name as many films this person is associated with as you can. Can't think of one, you're out. Another is called, 'Build a Title' in which player 1 names a movie and then player 2 needs to build onto that title with another movie title. For example, Player 1 says, 'Die Hard' and player 2 might then say, 'Die Hard Days Night' then player 3 may say, 'Die Hard Days Nightmare on Elm Street' and so on. You can also build onto the first word as in, 'John Tucker Must Die Hard Days Nightmare on Elm Street.' It's fun to see how long a title you can build. It becomes more collaborative than combative. \n\nListen to his podcast for more game ideas. The games aspect is pretty well the whole show. ", "We play a variation of six degrees where one player names two actors and every other player tries to come up with a connecting string ala six degrees.  However, there's no limit to the number of connections.  Sometimes you can connect them in one move, sometimes it takes a dozen.  It's not required for the player naming the actors to have a string in mind.  \n\nIt's fun because a player will typically try to come up with two very different actors, such as trying to connect Rob Schneider with Daniel Day Lewis.  The first player to come up with a connecting string gets to name the next two actors.  \n\nWe play another variation on this where a player names two actors who were in the same movie and the rest of the players have to guess the movie.

(self.movies)": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/78isxh/when_did_superhero_movies_being_fun_become_a/", "Ok, I‚Äôm a superhero fan, I enjoy the products, I enjoy the movies, but recently I‚Äôve noticed a disdain from fanboys for the word ‚Äúfun‚Äù being used to describe these movies.\nGrowing up I used to read quite a few Marvel and DC superhero comics (I still do if I‚Äôm looking for a quick and easy read on the occasional boring Sunday), I was always quite fascinated by some of their darkness, the oddly sexual content, their graphic violence and gore. I felt like I was reading something ‚Äòadult,‚Äô something that made feel mature. Other kids were only watching cartoons, I was reading The Thing squashing Dr Doom‚Äôs head like a tomato. Avengers being tortured and possibly raped by the villainous Hood.\nAs I grew older and stepped away from superhero comic books more and more of superhero films were starting to be released so I got back in the mood and started to pick up and re-read my old faves, and even some stuff I missed, but I realised something: a lot of the darkness, violence, mature ideas, and sex wasn‚Äôt really necessary. I‚Äôd even argue it got in the way of the story most of the time. It wasn‚Äôt even the occasional comic that get singled out for being too extreme, it was most of them (I saw Spider-Man be caught having sex on the ceiling with a new character because they had ‚Äúextreme uncontrollable sexual impulses.‚Äù It was just random with a BS excuse attached as its reasoning). It reached a point where I started get quite repulsed by the whole thing.\nI don‚Äôt mean to sound insulting with what I‚Äôm about to say but this is just my opinion: I think a lot of the ‚Äúdarker‚Äù and ‚Äúmature‚Äù elements present in Superhero comic books are there to appease the appetite of an older audience reading comics about children‚Äôs characters from the 1960‚Äôs. The comics that successfully go in this direction without me thinking it‚Äôs just fan-service are very few and in between. \nThe desire for ‚Äúmature‚Äù ‚Äúdarker and violent‚Äù movies about characters currently on Cartoon Network and Disney Channel is quite bizarre to me. Cant these films just be good? Isn‚Äôt that the most important part? Shouldn‚Äôt we be more concerned over whether the content from the characters currently and consistently being marketed to children is actually suitable for children?\nHonestly I‚Äôm not that bothered if these films are all fun. I‚Äôve seen about 65 films this year and only 6 were superheroes, I have a variety of stuff to choose from, and there‚Äôs already a ton of superhero movies with varying degrees in tone, but this whole ‚Äúwhy is this good film not dark‚Äù thing is really strange to me. Why can‚Äôt a film just be great at being fun?\n", ["Depends. Some superhero films need a darker tone (Batman, Venom, Logan, etc) while others should be more lighthearted (Guardians Of The Galaxy, Spider-Man, Deadpool, etc).", "Just anecdotal evidence but it's damn sure not a problem to me. The MCU has a solid balance between comedy and drama that feels relatable and matches the optimistic tone of the characters.", "Mature and darker doesnt mean better. Fun escapism is always needed in the world of film, esp sci-fi fantasy films.", "The problem isn‚Äôt that they‚Äôre ‚Äúfun‚Äù. It‚Äôs a two part problem.\n\n**#1.** Some movies are fun because the director is clearly having a fun time making a movie. (Edgar Wright movies, McTiernan movies, etc.) - most ‚Äòfun‚Äô blockbusters feel like something thinktanked to a point of being scientifically guaranteed to hit all the points necessary to be classified as ‚Äòfun‚Äô.\n\nBlockbusters are just the result giant machine engineered to push all the right buttons and extract money from you. Almost pornographic in a way.\n\n**#2 The Biggest Problem.** A lot of movies are sacrificing good storytelling for the sake of appearing fun. Taking your film seriously has become somewhat of a meme. You‚Äôll have a movie when the climax is happening and the stakes are high and then a character cracks a joke and we get a pause for laughter - if the character isn‚Äôt taking the situation seriously, why should we?\n\nIf you look at examples from good, ‚Äòfun‚Äô movies like Die Hard or Indiana Jones. These guys are fun characters, but when push comes to shove they are also very serious (they act like real people in a dangerous situation).\n\nBeyond that, I think fun/meta humor has also become a copout for bad/low-confidence storytelling. Instead of picking something and committing to it, writers will have a character point out how inherently stupid or nonsensical something is. It seems like a cheap way for writers to excuse legitimate problems. (ie. ‚ÄúLook, we‚Äôre so self aware, we see this plot hole too!!‚Äù). This immediately ruins my immersion.\n\nI think there are definitely good and bad examples of both in recent times. Mad Max: Fury Road, Baby Driver, Don‚Äôt Breathe, Nolan‚Äôs Batman trilogy, etc. are ‚Äòfun‚Äô movies.\n\nFun for the sake of fun is as bad as serious for the sake of serious.

Because we want to buy into the fantasy of being able to stop crime. \n\nBut when the movies get darker and more violent, it‚Äôs harder to ignore the troubling implications that come with those kind of strong arm tactics. \n\nThat‚Äôs why I like the original Superman movie and Raimi‚Äôs Spider-Man movies. They‚Äôre goofy, innocent, and earnest.

One that does it well in my opinion is The Princess Bride.", "I think you're raising two separate (but obviously connected points). One is the insistence by some corners (/r/movies being a major culprit) that darkness equals maturity. And as you rightly point out that's absolutely not true. In fact, the misuse of dark, macabre, or grotesque content to add false \"weight\" or \"shock\" to a piece is actually deeply immature. The comics you're pointing out (I'm guessing early to mid 90s) were absolutely aimed at appealing to the juvenile impulses of a slightly older audience that had grown up with the characters. I mean I don't think you can look at a Rob Liefeld drawing and disagree.\n\nThat said the current pushback against \"fun\" super hero movies really does seem justified. Iron Man came out nearly 10 years ago and since then the vast majority of Super Hero movies have followed the \"Action Comedy\" aesthetic. And that seems like a complete waste of the fairly rich stories that these movies could pull from. I mean the very fact that \"Super Hero Movies\" are a genre and not a subject seems sort of wrong. There's really nothing that would prevent a true Drama or Thriller (Captain America 2 doesn't count!) being created with these characters. However it honestly seems like Marvel has been remaking the same movie for the better part of a decade and DC, after realizing you can't just channel Christopher Nolan, seems to be doing the same. \n\nMy ultimate hope is that the current wave of Super Hero movies makes the characters and tropes so deeply embedded in the culture that in the future Heroes will be like Cops, or Kings  - where you can have a comedy, drama, romance, thriller, etc with the character and have it be completely normal.\n", "i like the colorful fun ones like guardians one and the upcoming thor ragnarok", "A lot of people just hate superhero movies on principle.", "I don't think the problem is that they're fun, but rather that they can be fun in very similar, formulaic ways.\n", "It seems a lot like hype backlash and hating popular things that have lead to \"fun\" being a \"problem\".

Pretty much all of his films are about people and their meetings, mixed with alcohol, conversations, love, sex, happenings, complications in relations, and the past. Many describe him as a Korean Woody Allen, which I can understand, but even if their films are a bit similar, they are quite different too. Hong Sang-soo also plays with the narrative times, which makes his films even more interesting. Probably the most interesting South Korean director working today.

The characters are all idiotic and unlikeable, especially the main character. The killer is not charismatic at all. The suspense is maintained artificially.

Let's get a list of suggestions going as we wait for the new season, perhaps the mods could organize  a single list. To get the most of these movies, simply watch them as Black Mirror episodes.\nWeiner (2016): staggering documentary about the now disgraced politician and his downfall because of serial sexting and the following public scandal. Both him and his wife Huma Abedin (Hillary Clinton's \"personal assistant\") come across as predictably power-hungry, but their depiction is also often nuanced, showing Weiner's gift of the gab and Huma's occasional vulnerability. It reminded me of \"Nosedive\", \"Shut up and Dance\", \"Hated in the Nation\" and perhaps \"The National Anthem \" as well. Remember: this couple was part of Hillary Clinton's inner circle up until a few months ago, and Huma herself would almost certainly have been assigned a top position in the Executive had Clinton won the election. \neXistenZ (1999): the movie's plot (playing a \"Playtest\"-like VR game w/ real consquences)  also parallels The Beatles' \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" (particularly the lyric's last line): watch the movie, listen to the song and find out. \nCosmopolis (2012): another David Cronenberg movie (btw \"Videodrome\" is also a good option), this one is  shot almost entirely inside a fully geared-connected limo, and it's about a  billionaire's descent into a spiral of speculation and information trading of all kinds.\nAntiviral (2012): directed by Cronenberg's son Brandon, it portrays a world where catching celebrities diseases is a thing.\nHer (2013): the  muted efficiency of the architecture and social interactions points to a dour sociability resembling several Black Mirror episodes. Visually, the angular, futurist looking shots of buildings reminded me of \"Hated in the Nation\", whereas the plot resembles \"Be Right Back\" and the characters  look and behave in a slightly impersonal \"Nosedive\" manner.\nKing of Kong (2007): on the surface, it's a well-known underdog story, but consider the premise for a moment: a hierarchy of adults built upon the zeros and ones of an 80's arcade game. \nWhen asked two months ago for suggestions, this is what Brooker mentioned:\n\"Here's a random list: Quatermass and the Pit Inside No.9 Mr Robot Hammer House of Horror The Year of the Sex Olympics I haven't actually seen Utopia, but ppl always tell me it's 'very Black Mirrorish' - so that too.

Bonus points if both.\n", ["There's [Blue Spring](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309291/reference) - which is about the troubled youth and apathetic teachers at a school in Japan. This is more a drama/thriller with a bit of violence.\n\nThere's [Evil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338309/reference) - which is a about a troubled teen who is sent to boarding school where bullying has plagued the students. This is mostly a drama.\n\nAnd with a silly recommendation there's [Fight Back to School](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fight_back_to_school/) - which is a comedy featuring Stephen Chow (Kung Fu Hustle, Shaolin Soccer) who plays a police officer who goes undercover at a high school.\n\nI know these aren't what you're looking for but with 0 comments I thought what the heck.", "Boys on the Run is set with guys in the workplace but a sort of similar high level concept -  unhappy, rivals, duking it out over a girl.

As someone who usually only catches the big indie films that pop up from universal critical love, I have no idea where to begin, so I would appreciate any recommendations from folk who have the service, or happen to know what's on there.\n", ["I get it for free through my library, all I've seen so far is Gaslight, The Holy Mountain, and And Then There Were None. It's kind of a shitty ui.", "How to find what to watch? I wrestle with the same issue. I think everyone does. How do you know where to start when these films often do not have known stars? I'm quite familiar with Indieflix I'm the CEO and co-founder. The QuickPick tool is a great place to start as is Staff Picks. You can choose by genre and how much time you have then click QuickPick and curated 15 sec clips will start playing. You just swipe and the next one pops up. It's kind of like flipping channels without ever hitting a commercial. You can also add them to your MyList to watch later. I hope this helps. Some of my favorite short films are, Spider, Bit Players, Down The Road, Bargain, Dik, Project Alpha and the new British crime drama series Injustice or the HBO series from Europe The Inbetweeners. You can find the staff picks under channels. Hope this helps. I'm new to Reddit and totally intimated so I hope I start to get this down and can freely converse with others on this topic.
