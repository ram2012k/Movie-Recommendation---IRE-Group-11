The man is absolutely fascinating. He is a mindboggling American cultural hero. His movie The Touch of Evil begins with a title card that hopes you will enjoy this '*Visual Pattern*'.\n\nHe called his movie a 'visual pattern'. I'll never forget that. It's chillingly pretentious and yet absolutely fitting of his work. His movies *are* a kind of visual pattern. They move in a totally unique way. You can tell he obsesses over every shot. When a camera reframes a scene, it reframes it so perfectly you'll get these moments when a camera pans over someone's shoulder and the actor is standing in such a way that you can see through a gap in their arm - hands on hip - to a table where all the main characters are sitting. Perfectly blocked. Perfectly staged. It's weird how masterful he is with movement and composition. He may be better at using a black n' white canvas than Akira Kurosawa, which doesn't even seem possible. \n\nHe's also a really weird guy which also helps when learning about him. **So to get into Citizen Kane I would recommend**:\n\n[RKO 281: The Battle for Citizen Kane](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120801/)\n\nThis was a HBO special on the making of Citizen Kane. It's not a documentary, it's a dramatic movie starring Liev Schreiber as Orson Welles and John Malkovich as the screenplay writer. James Cromwell plays Randolph Hearst and Liam Cunningham (Davos Seaworthy from GoT) shows up to play the cinematographer.\n\n[F is for FAKE!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072962/) one thing you should know about Orson Welles is that he is an **EDITOR** first and foremost. Yes he is a director too, but he is literally *the person* cutting the film. That's not someone else in his creative machine. It's him taking scissors to film. *HIS* film. The thing to notice while watching F is for FAKE is Orson Welles cutting techniques. The story is interesting, but the *way* it's told is captivating. Visually, the way this movie has been constructed is nothing short of beautiful.\n\nAlso you get to see Orson Welles trundle about in his big silly cape.\n\n[Touch of Evil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052311/?ref_=nm_knf_i2) might be his most famous apart from Kane but it's not anywhere near my favorite. I love the setting. The camera work is next level. There is a reason why this movie is the grand-daddy of modern day 'oners'. It is start to finish incredible. That said, I find Charlton Heston in 'hispanic-face' to be pretty off putting as a character and a person. At least half of the movie is Charlton Heston telling his newly wed wife to stay home and go away.\n************************\nOnce you get a little more into his life then I'd recommend [Chimes at Midnight](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059012/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), but not before you're in deep as an Orson Welles fanatic.\n************************\nAs for movies before Citizen Kane that would help you get into it more well . . .\n\nI don't have many films before 1940 I actually enjoy. I mean in 1940 you got Fantasia from Disney which I don't think will be much help and then you've got Rebecca from Hitchcock which I don't think will be much help either. Rebecca is great, Hitchcock is probably Orson Welles best contemporary. I mean maybe John Huston's in there too with movies like The Maltese Falcon but my collection doesn't go much further back than 1940. \n\nI'm aware of older movies like Nosferatu and the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, but I don't watch those for pleasure. Hitchcock is always going on and on about how DW Griffith changed everything and wrote the language of cinema so you might want to look some of his stuff up. ", "Gone With the Wind  \nThe Life of Emile Zola  \nStagecoach  \nThe Adventures of Robin Hood  \nRebecca  \nGrapes of Wrath  \nSullivan's Travels", "Fritz Lang's M (1931)", "Orson Welles is unique unto himself, so watching other movies of the period really won't help you appreciate Kane more. Kane is more of a starting point for Welles' career (and arguably the highlight). \n\nHowever, if you really need to watch other films, check out some filmed by Gregg Toland, who photographed Kane and is, again arguably, as much responsible for its stature as Welles is. \n\nSo I recommend: \n\n* Grapes of Wrath\n* The Little Foxes\n* Dead End\n* Wuthering Heights\n* The Westerner\n* Ball of Fire\n\nThat's a lot of variety and while it might not help you appreciate Kane, they're all terrific movies on their own. In fact, you might appreciate them more after seeing Kane rather than the other way around.

I'd like to point out that only one directly has to do with cowboys, and the rest include the culture because of the time and location but are most definitely not about cowboys.\n\nthe other story arcs include:\n\nthe union pacific story\n\nthe outlaw story\n\nthe ranger story\n\nthe tycoon/imperial story\n\nthe cavalry vs indians story\n\nand the revenge story.\n\n\nif you can't find a western that doesn't revolve around a cowboy, something not all westerns are limited too, then i don't know if i can help you, you just might view all westerns as movies with \"cowboys\" walking around during the gold rush, or the ex-confederate migration west as a bunch of \"cowboys\" walking around killing time, or the railroads charting across the continent as being a \"cowboy\" byproduct.  \n\nwhat is your interpretation of a cowboy? what do you think cowboys did out west? also, who do you think cowboys were? i'm not being cynical, your answer will determine what era of westerns you are looking for. \n\ncowboys were part of the cattle trade that dominated/dictated a lot of the development and re-population of the west as a frontier, or continuation of the American Frontier following the war of independence. long story short, frontier/western fiction was around long before America was America, the Europeans had been pushing west long before America was entitled. There were many influences for western fiction, from various cultures.\n\nwhen movies came to replace vaudeville, the Western was already an adaptable genre, hence why the earliest films were often westerns. each decade following the 1930's (when talkies came out, it temporarily sputtered western production) brought with it a different era of western, each with definitive traits and characteristics. you might have heard of many sub genres, i.e. spaghetti westerns which were largely filmed in Spanish and Italian locations with European actors as background filler. a lot of the Eastwood westerns were spaghetti's, as in not very American either which was suiting because this period also followed the earliest revisionist period, when America and Hollywood became critical of the inevitability of war and the celebration of America expansionism as witnessed in her love of reconstruction through violence. \n\n\nagain only a small fraction actually relates to the cowboy, even if that is the iconic figure of Americana. the cattle trade and cowboys are often confused with the many conflicting and amalgamating cultures/lifestyles that occupied the west at that time. as an example, outlaws aren't necessarily cowboys, so Jesse James or Billy the Kid movies aren't about cowboys at all. one underlining note from all westerns prior to the 60's was American superiority over indigenous cultures, and after the 60's Hollywood went back and rewrote a Kevin Costner version of history (he did his own in the 90's) where the natives were idolized for the virtues and put up on a shelf to admire for their non-brutish qualities (again, very different from factual history, the counter culture of the 60's hated Vietnam and war and saw America doing to the Vietnamese what they did to the Natives, this spawned the obsession with Native lore and smoking weed and growing long hair as a statement that modern society was somehow less intuitive than the inferior hunter/gatherer cultures they had stomped out. \n\n\nEdit: thank you to whoever gave me Reddit gold, that is the first time I've ever received gold. whoever you are, thank you, and I hope you get a chance to check out more Westerns if you aren't familiar, or if you are, thank you for reading what I had to say. I feel the genre will one day enjoy a resurgence, it has stood the test of time long after the frontier closed up, as it can be constantly re-adapted to relate with modern audiences, much in the same way Gene Roddenberry adapted his story of star trek as \"the wagon-train to the stars\" in order to relate a new generation to the old ways of bonanza and gunsmoke, or how westerns were a re-envisioning of older frontier folklore, as a way of relating even further back to round table knights and Arthurian chivalry.", "Jeremiah Johnson.

Western fiction and frontier fiction produced endless stories of one man striking it rich, it just depends on the resource that was popular then.

Dead Snow received a lot of hype and people either knew to love or hate it (it's about Nazi Zombies after their stolen gold). Dead Snow 2 is so much better but the assumption that sequels suck mean that no one has seen it either. In my mind, Dead Snow 1 is like Evil Dead 2 (the version they wanted to shoot with budget) and then Dead Snow 2 is like Evil Dead 3 where they just got balls out crazy.\n\nI also really liked Lady in the Water. Shyamalan gets a lot of shit but I think that this was his last enjoyable movie that I watched. I am fond of Urban Fantasy, stories-within-stories and meta-contextual movies. This move is all three. I think you require a certain level of 'literacy' before watching Lady in the Water. As another example for a film that people love: Cabin in the Woods. If you are not a fan of horror movies, Cabin in the Woods isn't clever or makes sense. Lady in the Water requires the same sort familiarity with the quest genre.\n\nI also normally hate Found Footage movies as they're an excuse for a company to shave 20-30 million dollars off of making a movie. There are a few exceptions that the cheapness enhances the film: Chronicle, Trollhunter, V/H/S, V/H/S 2 and Grave Encounters.\n\nI'm also fond of South Korean New Wave. I love gangster movies and here are a bunch of movies that have been updated. The last greatest North American gangster movie was Wolf of Wall Street but that isn't about the criminals I'm interested in. Before that, what? The Departed? That was made in 2007. With South Korean New Wave, I get a shit load of movies that have been shot recently so they look great. Another plus is that due to the lack of firearms in South Korea, each attempted assassination is a gritty affair where it can go either way. Eastern Promises bathhouse scene is a perfect example of drama: it could go either way. Plus I'm a fan of martial arts movies.\n\nThat's why Raid 2 was my favourite movie last year. You had the different gangs vie for dominance but once a leader gave the order to whack a guy, it wasn't one and done shoot out. \n\nEssentially, I like action movies because they take skill to make but the key is to have medium budgets. The reason is that you want the star to be doing the stunts, which a studio will have to insure. If the person is a superstar, then they're too expensive to insure and that's why you get so many action blockbusters look like shit because of the continual cuts of stunt doubles. I'm here for the charisma of the actor. That's why the only high budget action movies I'll watch will be animated or Tom Cruise - Tom Cruise is always an Executive Producer, he always does his own stunts and has the power to say \"Yes, you will be insuring me.\" Edge of Tomorrow is a prime example of this: high power mecha combat that looks realistic because Tom Cruise was willing to do the wire-fu and not rely on CGI that will look dated in 6 months. Jack Reacher is an amazing action-thriller because of this as well.\n\nThat's why with the relative unknown actors in South Korean movies, they can insure them and do *great* action scenes. Look towards Oldboy, Man from Nowhere and I Saw the Devil.\n\nOther great medium budget (15-50M) movies include:\n\n- John Wick\n\n- Snowpiercer\n\n- Ip Man\n\n- Ip Man 2\n\n- Mr. Brooks\n\n- Payback\n\n- The Losers\n\n- Kung Fu Hustle\n\n- Dredd (already listed though)\n\n- RocknRolla\n\nHaywire, for example, is an amazing action movie that got no one to watch because it starred a relatively unknown MMA fighter. With the medium budget and her skills, it was easy to insure her so they could actually do fight scenes that don't cut around and hide the action. The fights are gritty and real. I can't wait until Ronda Roussey gets her own action movie - the best fights in Fast 7 and Expendables 3 were her. Stop with the MMA shit, go be real action stars! \n\nIt's why Tony Jaa's movies got progressively worse. In Ong Bak he was some unknown guy so it was no problem having him do all of this dangerous stuff. Ong Bak 2, a lot safer because he was an international star. Then you look at Fast 7 and I don't see the man from Ong Bak.\n\nStudios have the opportunity to make unforgettable movies but forgo that for something safe, generic and forgotten. All because of insuring their stars. They're getting paid millions of dollars, take the temporary abuse for something that lasts forever. Sorry for dropping the essay but the current state of action movies annoys me to no end.

But the thin comfort of intentionally low expectations can not protect her when inanimate animals begin talking to her, telling her what to do, and driving her to distraction until she does as they say. \n\nWonderfalls starred the brilliant and beautiful Canadian actress [Caroline Dhavernas](http://www.imdb.com/media/rm1445763072/tt0361256). It was created by Bryan Fuller, the creator of Pushing Daisies, Dead Like Me, and Hannibal; Todd Holland, director from Malcolm In The Middle; and Tim Minear of Firefly fame (long time Joss Whedon collaborator) who helped produce, direct and write not only for Firefly, but for Angel, Drive, Dollhouse, and Terriers as well.\n\nWonderfalls, is one of the best comedy series ever made, and one of the most truly unique shows ever on TV, yet almost no one has heard of it, because like Firefly, Wonderfalls was the next to suffer at the tender mercy of Fox's incompetent marketing.\n\nLike they did with Firefly, once again with Wonderfalls, Fox managed to seize defeat from the jaws of victory, by starting the series mid-season with little advertising, and intentionally mislabeling Wonderfalls as a drama instead of a comedy (they did this because they were selling the show to their advertisers as the new Joan of Arcadia). They played the episodes out of order, changed the show time with little reason or notice, and then canceled Wonderfalls after only 4 episodes, without even bothering to show the other 9 episodes they already had made - because again like Firefly, 'Wonderfalls failed to gather a following'.\n\nLike Pushing Daisies, Wonderfalls has tremendous charm, beautiful imagery and a wonderful sense of humor, and like Firefly, Wonderfalls has a great cast, sympathetic characters, brilliant dialog, and plenty of 90 degree plot twists. \n\nBtw Jewel Staite (Kaylee from Firefly) is a guest star in some of the episodes and Lee Pace (yes the pie-man from Pushing Daisies) is a regular on the series.

But I think this movie manages to both be really good at for what it is while simultaneously striving to be more. I think it reinvigorated the then stale pg-13 teen comedy genre. So many of the movies that filled my adolescence were clearly influenced by this movie and I think its still the gold standard for what a teen movie should be: edgy enough that teens will want to watch it on their own but family-friendly enough that watching it with adults wouldn't make those teens want to tear their face off. \n\n**Anti-christ**/**Melancholia** both movies I didnt really *enjoy* or want to see again, but affected me more than most movies to an almost physical level and have still stuck firmly in my brain years later. Both have really great visuals that have huge emotional impact due to solid writing to back it up. \n\n**Drive** I've gotten into heated outright screaming matches over this movie. Some people argue it's all style and no substance but I argue that the style *is* the substance. Mimicking the protagonist, the movie says very little but makes you feel a whole lot. And I think thats a powerful statement in itself.\n\n**Rushmore** This is the first Wes Anderson movie I ever watched. It managed to be completely absurd while simultaneously devastatingly real. It also cemented in me the belief that movies could be more than the shit I was watching in theaters with my friends during the weekend. It was also the first time I consciously realized that the *way* something is filmed is just as important as *what* is being filmed. Up until that moment I was a book nerd who believed the difference between a good movie and a bad movie was simply script quality. \n\n**The Truman Show** again, beloved movie from my childhood. But this one I'll stand by as actually being a quality movie. My interpretation and response to the film has changed a lot as I've grown up, but I've never stopped responding. I think the odd anachronistic elements to the movie was perhaps just a style choice that paid of really well as its helped the movie a lot as it ages.\n\n**The godfather**/**pride and prejudice** (yes, the Keira knightley movie version)/**Fight Club**  . These are the movies that always spring to mind when people say that the book is always better than the movie. I think these are great examples to prove that staying true to the original intended reaction of the author is more important to pulling off a movie than staying true to the minutiae of the book itself. Simultaneously showing love and admiration to the source material while spitting in its face and telling it that its strupid drivel. Pride and Prejudice isnt objectively good but I think it does this amazing job of recognizing that Austens novels are the original architects for the romantic comedy genre and then appropriating the tropes of the modern genre back into the original story itself. Why be accurate (to the book or history in general) when you can have Mr. Darcy profess his love in the rain? \n\n**American Beauty** another movie that has struck different chords as I've grown up. I've gotten into some really interesting discussions on reddit about the different interpretations of the ending and I think its fascinating that every person seems to have a unique take. \n\n**Trainspotting** The biggest criticism of this movie has always been that its more fun than a movie about heroin addiction has any right to be. I disagree that the movie glorified heroin use itself but instead did a great job at depicting the real dangers of drugs: its not that everything is grisly and  dark and bleak all the time. Its that the enjoyable happy go lucky vibe just distracts you from how fucked up everything really is beneath the surface of denial. Drugs are fun...until they're not. \n\n**The Graduate** The movies plot kind of veers off a bit midway, but this movie is what made me realize that the times change, but people don't. My generation is not the first to experience young adult angst and confusion nor will we be the last.\n\n**500 Days of Summer** this movie is so self aware that it hurts. Zooey Deschanel cast as the cute manic pixie dream girl for the protagonist to project onto. Joseph Gordon levitt as the relatable every man we all see ourselves in and root for. Romantic comedy cliches galore. A lot of people think this is good for a rom com, but I argue its a good movie in general. But all of my support for why this is a genuinely quality movie requires you to have seen it. Which everyone should\n\n**Mysterious Skin** i had no idea what to expect going in, but it surpassed it regardless.\n\n**Edward Scissorhands** peak Tim Burton. Peak johnny depp. Basically a modern day fairy tale set in a world inspired but not based in reality. \n\n**Requiem for a Dream** this movie is basically the exact spiritual opposite of Trainspotting. Its the cinematic equivelant of 2 girls, 1 cups. Its uncomfortably blatant about the fact its shit, you want to look away because its undeniably shit, but for some reason you keep watching as scat porn devastates your very soul. Its melodrama inspired by DARE worthy rhetoric and hyperbole. Yet there's something about *this* particular shit filming that draws people in and makes a name for itself as something nobody enjoys or really wants to see, but also something somehow unavoidable and intwined into pop culture.\n\n**Hot Rod** this definitely isnt for everyone but I think thats kind of the point of cult films. Its better to be loved by few than liked by many. Very few people can stand this movie. But the ones who can stand it absolutely love it. \n\n**Punch Drunk Love** people love to complain about Adam Sandler pumping out shit year after year and how he should use his weight in the industry to produce something of quality. Those same people have not seen Punch drunk love and probably never will. There's that old saying something about how comedy is the wide shot and drama is the close up. This movie is quintessential Sandler (with all the recognizable mannerisms and traits of his most iconic characters and bits) but just shot as a drama and its amazing.\n\n**The Good Guys** this is another movie I've only seen once within the past year so I dont know how it will stand up over time. I watched this movie alone and a roommate later asked me what I'd been watching because \"you laughed a *lot*\". Definitely the funniest movie I've seen in a long time.", "Saving private Ryan\n\nPulp Fiction \n\nMajor League \n\nThere will be blood \n\nThe Life Aquatic (with Steve Zissou)", "Back to the Future\n\nDrive\n\nGoodfellas\n\nWhiplash\n\nLost in Translation", "For now and I couldn't pick just 5  -\n\nNo Country For Old Men\n\nClueless\n\nChina Town\n\nHell or High Water\n\nFight Club\n\nThe Big Lebowski\n\nGoodfellas\n\nSeven\n\nFargo\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nBreakfast at Tiffany's\n\nGood Will Hunting\n\nThe Town\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nVertigo\n\nPsycho\n\n\nUgh I can go on and on.\n", "City of God\n\nThe Truman Show\n\nPulp Fiction\n\n12 Angry Men\n\nThe Shinning ", "Big Trouble in Little China\n\nJaws\n\nThere Will be Blood\n\nThe Thing\n\nThe Big Lebowski ", "Goodfellas, American Psycho, Drive, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Swingers", "Here's a smattering of my top five.

He's the one creating strict rules that you probably applied to yourself if you tried drugs in your life (don't use it too much, don't use it in public, especialy at school or while driving, don't let it become a central thing in your life, keep folowing more important goals, like a sane love relationship or traveling to Tibet)\n* The popular guy who parties all the time. He dies from an accidental overdose while trippin' too much with the addict.\n* Andrew, The youngest and unconfident guy. He has no friends and a shitty family situation (mom dying from cancer). He became an addict because of this, because he was depressed. He ultimately destroyed his own self by abusing drugs. The two other guys will try to reason with him.\n\n\nThe thing in the cave ? A metaphore. It's realy just the first time the three of them did drug together, and the first time Andrew tried it after the popular guy spent some time convincing it to try it.\n\nThe incident with the car ? Just a car accident, probably because the driver was high. Why didn't they use their super power in this situation ? Why were they so panicked ? Because they were high and they knew they messed up.\n\nIn the cemetary, when Andrew makes the camera fly, the other guy basically is saying \"Are you joking right now ? Dude realy, you are high right now in this situation ?! Who do I talk to about your addiction ?!\"\n\n\nThe whole movie is a metaphore so it's difficult to find definite proofs. If you really need one, just ask yourself why the dad reacts the way he did when he watched videos of his son \"playing with super powers\". A normal dad would be like \"DUDE ! You're FLYING with your friends, you have super power, WTF that's cool !!\". But because he is a normal dad, with a lot of concerns with he's dying wife, his reaction is to have a talk with his son. The whole dialog is clearly related to drug (including the fact that Andrew steals money from his dad to buy drugs).\n\n\nJust watch the movie again knowing this, it should become obvious. If you have not experienced drugs with friends in high school/college, nor basic knowledge of recreational use of drugs, then it's normal that you will mostly miss the point of the movie."]], "[Suggest] Enemy of the State - Nearly 20 years old but somehow more relevant as it tackle the problems of a surveillance state and when its hijacked for nefarious means.

Watching the pampered daughter of a super-wealthy Coca Cola CEO fall in love with a young militant communist is hilarious. \n\nAnd The Great Dictator is Chaplin's take on Hitler, pre-American involvement in WWII. Chaplin saw a lot of bad shit on the horizon and was born several days apart from Hitler. He made The Great Dictator as a warning to the people of the present and future, although the names are changed a bit--the Great Dictator himself is a man named Hynkel, and the political faction that he leads isn't represented by a swastika but by two X's--the Order of the Double-Cross. There are some amazing sequences of physical and verbal comedy, and it's pretty cool to see how many modern comedians are inspired by Chaplin's performance in this film, particularly Mike Myers of all people.\n\nSorry for writing a novel-length post, I know these films might not sound similar to What We Do In the Shadows but they really are in the same world of self-aware, timely comedy and dedication to telling a great story.

Like Groundhog Day, it's kind of an everything movie with action, drama, humor, tension, and strong character development. I highly recommend this one, as many didn't catch it the first time around. Edit: I truly find it to be one of the greatest sci fi movies of all time.\n\nAlien- A movie that takes a haunted house plot structure, which is usually plagued with problems of stupidity and makes it brilliant by using a creature whose life cycle and abilities are completely alien to us. The world is in space but low tech, giving a kind of mundanity to the setting that is impressively twisted into anxiety once it becomes clear how the creature can utilize it. The blue collar characters are likeable and underestimate it for completely understandable reasons, which is more than can be said for almost any other \"monster picks them off\" movie. This movie has pretty much just has one single shot that doesn't hold up (happy birthday), and everything else is excellent.\n\nThe Terminator- A pursuit movie that takes advantage of the time it came out almost frighteningly well with neon clubs, big hairdos, and punk outfits emphasizing how humanity is at the edge. It's ultimately best to walk into this movie knowing nothing, but it's still so well done that knowing everything is hardly an issue. It builds its world excellently, makes its characters human quickly, and manages its tension frighteningly well. I personally recommend it over the second one due to it managing its tension and pacing better; it also plays with audience expectations better with what the villain can survive. The SNES music can be offputting though.\n\nThe Iron Giant- An animated movie that takes the structure of ET and polishes it to near perfection. Practically every character has a ton of personality, practically every scene has excellent direction both in plot (relationship-wise) and cinematography, and practically every moment in this movie can move you to laughter or tears. The story is set during the 50s and takes full advantage of the setting's conflicting paranoia of nukes and serenity of home life to make comments on humanity and choice with the eponymous robot at the center of it all.

It looks great with the year that the movie was released.", "**Shadow of a Doubt** is a good one to watch, especially if you like Hitchcock. It feels like Hitchcock's first real \"family\" blockbuster.\n\nThe Big Sleep by Howard Hawks is a poor imitation of **The Maltese Falcon** by John Huston. It's not a bad movie, but watch Humphrey Bogart play exactly the same role in Maltese Falcon and you'll know which one is better. If you absolutely must watch something with The Big . . . something in the title, watch **The Big Chill** by Lawrence Kazdan. A criminally underrated adult version of the Breakfast Club.\n\n**Strangers on a Train** would be my favorite Hitchcock if they weren't all so good. Robert Walker as the villain is phenomenal.\n\n**High Noon** is one of my favorite westerns. It's less about shoot outs and more about one man trying to round up a posse. There's a poignant \"you will deny me three times\" jesus allegory happening here that's fascinating to see unfold. \n\n**On the Waterfront** is rightly a great movie. I rewatch some of the monologues on a probably bi-monthly schedule. The priest's 'This is my Church!' speech and Marlon Brando's confrontation with George C Scott are legendary.\n\n**Paths of Glory** is probably my favorite movie. It's definitely my favorite Kubric movie. Actually no, I know I've said this to myself and others so I'll say it here. It's not my favorite movie, but it is the *best* made movie I know. \n\n**Cat on a hot Tin Roof** is a close contender to my favorite movie. I often say 'Bull!' and 'Big Daddy' and 'Mendacity . . .'  warmly remembering this movie. I adore every part of it. I love watching Paul Newman trundle around in his big leg cast. I love his portrayal of alcoholism. I love that awful woman and her terrible singing children. I love that the movie ends on an explicit sex reference. Perfect movie 10/10.\n\n**Rio Bravo** is also genuinely good. You would not believe how many movies stole the idea of blood dripping down from the rafters. Guess what? Started here. A classic movie about a team that comes together to get the job done. It's the western of the avengers.\n\n**North by Northwest** is a classic Hitchcock show stopper. I said Shadow of a Doubt was his first family block buster, well this is his action/adventure/comedy block buster.\n\n**Anatomy of a Murder** is *THE* movie that created the 'simple country lawyer' routine. James Stewart is fantastic in the part. George C Scott shows up to play a slick New York lawyer that works as a perfect foil. It explores the justice system with a ruthless honesty, that while it's procedural elements of how a court work do veer into Perry Mayson territory sometimes, none the less ends with a complex and satisfying look at justice.  \n\n**The Wild Bunch** is a fun deconstruction of westerns. In the opening ten minutes, I think more bullets are fired than I had seen in the previous five years. This movie takes a 'shoot out' and turns it up past 11. \n*******************************\nThis is pretty fun. I could go on, but as it would take all day I think I'll stop.

There's a ton of excellent cinematography which when you take in the context of 12 actors just standing around a single room with a table is kind of amazing. If nothing else 12 Angry Men should be taught to aspiring directors as a lesson in just how many incredibly well composed shots you can take of a single compressed location.\n\nCharade.

Totally unnecessary remake that completely ruins the spirit of the original. All of the subtlety of the original is gone and the film is crappy Hollywoodized knock off for people that couldn't be bothered to read subtitles. They added horrendous special effects and CGI - Eli looks like a typical exorcist themed demon with rubberized jerky movements ... wtf\n\nLet me In is a shot for shot remake and often feels insultingly targeted to a simple minded audience with everything completely spelled out.\n\nThe lead child actors in the original were absolutely fantastic, although the remake had good actors they weren't directed well and don't live up to the performances in the original (Chloe Moretz mumbles throughout the movie). Their chemistry just doesn't work and the wonderful childhood friendship/romance of the original is gone.\n\nThe excellence of the original's cinematography is completely gone - it nicely captures a cold feel, the original uses warmer yellowish tones which doesn't work.

It's the nurture concept where anti-social behavior is brought about by bad parenting and substandard living conditions. Vampires are just bad because, well... they are vampires.

Great vampire created a child actress who skillfully depicts the loneliness of a very old vampire existing in a small girl's body. Excellent.", "I would like to add something to those shitting on the American version. First of all, it's not really a remake of the film Let the Right One In. It is the director's version of the BOOK Let the Right One In and the author actually helped the director on writing the screenplay. He took that story and made it into his own, and in my opinion, made it better. Contrary to the popular belief that the story is not supposed to be about the girl vampire trying to find a boy to do her dirty work...it really is. In this sense the American version is more accurate of the book since the Swedish film focuses on the somewhat lighter side of the story and not as much of the dark stuff. Yes she genuinely likes the young boy in the story and enjoys being his friend but being a vampire is all about survival first and enjoying life second. They crave blood and will do anything in their power to get it (it is how they survive after all) but due to the girl being stuck in a young body it is very dangerous for her to go through with this by herself...so she finds someone else to do it. It is made clear that she was manipulating the first man she was with in both films. He fell in love with her when he was young (this is shown by the young boy finding an old picture of the girl with a young man) and dedicated his life to keeping her alive. I'll also add that this man was in fact a pedophile which is somewhat hinted by their relationship and is also made abundantly clear in the novel. Anyways, once this man kills himself the girl needs someone else to take his place and the young boy is there for her. Of course she's not just going to outright ask him if he wants to help her out but he has seen what she is and still accepts her. They even run off together in the end which leaves you wondering what their future really holds and I believe the young boy will have the same awful fate as the first man she was with (who knows maybe there were many before him as well). It's a very dark but still somewhat innocent love story but the important thing to remember is that the girl will always focus on getting blood before love. She will be willing to manipulate even someone she loves to get this and the American version does a good job of making this clear.\n\nAlso, those who think the CGI is bad in the American one....what about the cat lady catching fire in the Swedish version? That was just as awful and almost humorous to watch because of its poor quality", "This is a pretty good film.\n\nIf you are into good vampire movies, check out Interview with a Vampire.

I wasn't really rooting for the kid, I was engaged and along for his ride, but I really wasn't wishing him success. The kid is kind of an asshole to everyone around him.

It should be a place to celebrate the love of movies, not the use of movies as emotional abuse.\n\nFrom a peek at your posting history, you seem like a cool person. So I just want to reach out and say, this is not something you do to a person you love.\n\nIt should absolutely be your goal to share the films you love with her, and enjoy movies together, but this is not the way.\n\nImagine a sex position you're really into, to which she has a strong aversion. Would you force her into it or try and ease her into it in a safe environment? Which has the better chance of her eventually liking it and pleasuring you with?\n\nAnd I would even go a step further than easing her into tense movies. First find a middle ground. Why suffer through her shit, when you can try and find romantic comedies or dramas that have some edge to them that can keep you entertained as well?\n\nThink about it - you're the one who can help her discover amazing new frequencies in which to enjoy movies. You can get her to new levels of excitement from cinema, and love that she is able to experience it, without losing her wits.\nYou can be her surrogate into a whole new world of entertainment.\nThe key is empathy.\n\nAs you venture into movie nights with escalating tension, remember how it feels for her. Let her hold you whenever she needs. Let her know you can \"pull out\" at any moment, or in this case pause for a minute before going back in. Make her feel safe enough with you, to take a risk versus the screen, because you're in this together.\nKeep the lights on so the movie doesn't completely overtake her reality.\n\nI can tell you that my SO of ten years did not care for darker films when we met, but we got to the point where she enjoyed the hell out of 30 Days of Night, and laughed her ass off in Zombieland.\n\nI say start with something like [Watching the Detectives](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472205/combined). Though it is categorized as rom-com, it's much more wickedly fun than the usual cookie cutter romance crap. But more importantly, it champions embracing excitement and tension as a way to live a fully flavored life.\nThis way, you're not only breaking her in with the movie's tension level, but also warming her up to it through the movie's actual content. Much like sex positive sessions, try and find tension-positive movies.\n\nI find that comedy thrillers help lubricate the tension with humor.\n\n[Duplicity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135487/combined). Remember, baby steps. It's a corporate espionage romantic comedy that's not without tension, but hinges mostly on reversals, which will keep her guessing too much to care about tension.\n\nNext up, [The Whole Nine Yards](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190138/combined). Yes, I'm sorry. Gotta make some sacrifices if you want to make it work.\nReasoning: again, it has rom-com wrapping paper, but the inside package has freaking assassins. Seriously, almost every other character is a killer. Also - theme - about a dentist with a safe life who decides to allow for fear and danger in order to be with the one he loves.\n\n[Fletch](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089155/combined) - there's a serious investigation underneath it all, one which even leads to a life threatening confrontation, but it's all so irreverent that it almost feels like there are no stakes. ALMOST.\n\n[The 'Burbs](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096734/combined) - much more tense than Fletch, but also sillier and more innocent.\n\nNext, [Stakeout](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094025/combined) - first part juvenile pranks, second part budding romance juxtaposed with surveillance - it plays with the tension in a fun way, third part tense as fuck (for her). The large doses of charm and humor throughout the first half will help her become invested enough to see it through. Again, there's an underlying theme of putting yourself in the dangerous situation, for love.\n\n[Ghost](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099653/combined) - it looks like we're taking a step back, but it's deceiving. Ghost actually contains some scary bits for her. There's murder, and glimpses of dark forces from the netherworld, not to mention a final showdown. But it's all wrapped in romance and comedy, which will make the movie as a whole quite digestible.\n\n[Ghostbusters](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087332/combined) - fighting demons was never funnier. The movie treats really spooky stuff with such irreverence, and will hopefully help her tune into that state of mind. Bill Murray faces everything with such matter-of-fact nonchalance, and the sheer hilarity of Rick Moranis as a harbinger of doom.\n\n[Radioland Murders](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110939/combined) - a serial murder mystery threaded in an insanely relentless oldie-throwback vaudeville-esque comedy. It's not a great movie, but it's an exercise (for her) in mitigating a breathless pace, within the confines of comedy.\n\n[Leverage](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1103987/combined) - it's a TV show, and that's a good thing. It's about a group of do-good con artists and thieves, who swindle bad people. They put themselves in tense situations, but it has a general light tone and no matter what happens, you know they'll all be there for the next episode. It can do a lot to help build her mental stamina.\n\n[Hot Fuzz](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/combined) - It both builds towards high tension and damn funny throughout. Also, it's a great fucking movie.\n\n[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373469/combined). OK, time to play with the big boys now. Lots of hardcore tense moments here, but the comedy almost never lets up. Plus, breaking the fourth wall by a narrator helps immensely in diffusing the stress.\n\n[Sneakers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105435/combined) - training wheels coming off. Heist, surveillance, spying, murder. Lots of comedy in this thriller, but it has real life threatening stakes, many tense sequences, and no fourth wall narrator to hold her hand. And it has a feel-good vibe at the end, so she'll have a nice sense of release.\n\nIf this all feels a bit weird and random, it's because I'm writing half asleep, so if you need more suggestions, feel free to pm me tomorrow.\n\nCheers and good luck.", "Argo.", "Maybe Drive?

There has been an endless amount of zombie comedies in recent years (Warm Bodies, Shaun of the Dead, Life after Beth, Burying the Ex), but I do not know if they are any good.\nThere are also more recent TV-shows like *Santa Clarita Diet* and *i-Zombie*.\n\n-\n\nPossibly more of interest to you in terms of \"human interest\" or philosphical/ethical questions are *[Maggie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1881002)* (2015) and the upcoming *[The Cured](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3463106)*.\n\n-\n\nBut I must admit that I am a bit surprised at the terms you use to describe the genre:\n\n>why do zombies always act so hostile, no matter the situation? \n\nI do not believe zombies act hostile - they are (traditionally) more or less brain-dead creatures that only act on a feeding instinct. Hostility does not come into it - and neither does a reflection on the situation.\n\n>Isn't there some movie that plays in a zombie scenario which is actually an interesting movie with fresh ideas that doesn't make the zombies the center of the whole story?\n\nAs I said, I avoid zombie films as much as I can, but - talking in genre-specific terms - the best zombie films do actually have the humans and their behaviour (and treatment of each other) at the centre. The reason is that zombies are entirely devoid of personality, motivation, character development, etc. They are basically the physical manifestation of a natural desaster or an epidemic. So the only way you can turn this premise into a good film is by putting the human \"drama\" at the centre of your story. If it is done well, you probably have an interesting psychological study of how humans behave in a crisis. If it is done badly, you end up with a Hollywood desaster-action blockbuster.\n\nThe fact that zombies have no personality and are merely a metaphor for an epidemic makes them so entirely unappealing to me. They are the exact opposite of \"intelligent\", \"scheming\" vampires. But I do not want to ramble on endlessly (post is far too long already). I have written about my personal genre-definition at length on my blog: https://vampirefilmreviews.wordpress.com/blog/vampires-zombies-2-genre-definitions-and-intermingling/\n--- What I am trying to say is that the vampire genre offers [for the reasons just mentioned] (in my opinion) more leeway and more variation; but it will also often put the vampires at the centre. Whereas the zombie genre does offer less variation, but does (ideally) put the human characters at the centre. Which, for me, means that your desires (originality; zombies acting differently in different situations; zombies not centre of story) do lead in different directions a bit, as the first two are possibly better served in the vampire genre, whereas the third one might be better served in traditional zombie films (which you seem to criticise).\n\n\n"]], "Jordan Peele has seemingly coined the phrase \"social thriller\" using it for his film Get Out.

It was really eye opening, beautiful, and realistic.", "I was diagnosed with aspergers about 3 years ago as an adult. Every Aspie is different, but they also have some core common traits, but how they manifest can be wildly different. For example sensory issues, bananas are the only fruit I can eat due to the texture of other fruits not the taste, another aspie might have isses with other types food for textual reasons too. So the external behaviour seems different but the common one is a sensory one.\nThe issue with eye contact you raise is often misunderstood. It's not that aspies can't make eye contact it's that they make inappropiate eye contact. It's far more subtle then just looking away. Staring to long at someone can be just as damaging in social siutations as avoiding eye contact. Eye contact in human communication is very important and very complex and subtle, it's just that most people (NT's or nuero typpicals) do it automatically so they don't realise how complex it is. Aspies don't do this automatically\nNT communication is 70% body language 20& how you say something like tone of voice and 10% what you say.\nwith aspies it's the reverse\nto me the most important thing is what someone says not how they say it or their body language.\nAspies tend to take things very literally, so can often miss things like sarcasm or when someone is lying. I do unless I know the person well because then I have worked them out by then.\nAspies work through social interactions consciously instead of automatically which is why talking to more then 1 person at a time gets very difficult becuase their is so many variables to retain and process\nThis is the simplist way I can think of explaning aspergers to someone. There are a whole lot of other issues as well, but I feel this covers the social interaction side.\nAspies don't have difficulty with bodily contact unless they have some sensory issues with it for example soft gentle touch could be unpleasent but firm pressure might be nice. It would not be with all bodily contact. Or it might be with bodily fluids because they are gooey or sticky. Aspie behaviour is much more subtle. Films that raise awareness are good but they portray a rather simplistic view of the disorder. They tend to try and cram as many aspie traits into one character as possible, or make them very crude and obvious. I am very good at emulating being an NT which is why it took my so long to be diagnosed. Aspies learn this to survive in an NT world.\nHaven't watched the film might post more when I have. though from the trailer I would say that Adam's voice is too expressive, because the actor doesn't have aspergers.

It's beautiful, minimal, sleek in every way. The acting, story revelation, character development-- the pacing is perfect, IMO. The film leads you along a path with the young programmer as he tries to figure out Nathan's real motives. It makes you feel claustrophobic at times, which is a feeling hard to describe. The use of colour and teases of the outdoors make his modern architecture-porn research mansion feel more like a dystopian gulag.
