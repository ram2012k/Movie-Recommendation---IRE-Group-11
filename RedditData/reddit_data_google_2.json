(self.MovieSuggestions)": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/5j2o11/which_to_watch_nocturnal_animals_or_manchester_by/", "Both are getting great reviews, but I'm not sure which I want to watch. If you've seen one, or preferably both, which one would you recommend? Both interest me, but which should be the first priority?\n", ["Manchester\n", "Manchester is an excellent heavy human drama.  You feel like you're watching real people with complex, intricate problems and there are several incredibly emotional moments.  Casey Affleck and Lucas Hedges give two of the best acting performances of the year.  I personally wanted it to end differently but that's because I was putting my own experiences on the movie.  That's what it does, it makes you examine your own familial relationships.  It goes into father/son, uncle/nephew, parent issues combined with personal histories and traumas and how that affects our future actions.\n\nNocturnal Animals is an art house relationship thriller that is very stylish and pretty to look at.  If you are film-literate and can read subtext and extract the layers of meaning in a film than this is an excellent example of that.  It opens with probably one of the most notorious scenes of the year but there's a purpose to it.  There is an INCREDIBLY tense scene that lasts for about 15-20 minutes that will keep you on the edge of your seat as she starts reading the book that her ex-husband wrote and dedicated to her.  Amy Adams is great but the real scene stealers are Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson.  Tom Ford was able to string together 3 simultaneous stories quite nicely and it was easy to see the difference between them all and it was a pretty powerful ending when you can piece it all together.  You get present-day Amy Adams who is this rich high-class art gallery owner, you get the past where you see how she met her ex-husband (Jake Gyllenhaal in role #1), and then you get the story of the book she's reading that was written by her ex-husband and how it's an allegory for how she made him feel when they were married (Jake Gyllenhaal in role #2, Michael Shannon, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher).  I had the wonderful opportunity to hear Ford speak about the film at a Q&A at a film festival and it was great hearing him talk about all of the reasons for making the choices he did in the film.  It allowed me to see just how truly layered and intricate the film is.  It's a film about adult relationships, regrets, and revenge.  It's a bit disturbing and upsetting at times.\n\nManchester is the more accessible, mainstream film of the two but both are great if you're OK with more challenging films.  It depends on what you're in the mood for. Heavy drama that may make you cry (Casey Affleck is likely going to win the Oscar for Best Actor for this role), or a tense, precise, sharp revenge thriller that looks gorgeous.\n\nIf you have to pick one, Manchester is probably the better of the two overall.

He's like French Stanley Donnen, but better. Essential films: The Umberellas of Cherbourg, The Young Girls of Rochefort, Lola\n\n- Agnes Varda\nEasily one of, if not the most, influential female director and one of my favorite. Many of her works considered feminist because of her use of female protagonists and creating female cinematic voice. She likes to use protagonists that are rejected members of society--a scraper, a homeless vagabond, etc. Her films looks are almost documentarian in nature.

Trivia: Her husband was Jacques Demy until Demy's death\n\n- Claude Chabrol\nThis guy is often cited as the French Hitchcock (and rightly so).

For example (SPOILER), when the King dies after slaying the sea dragon, the Queen picks up the heart without looking at her dead husband. And that was it, there was no drama, no effort to hammer home how indifferent the Queen was about his death; neither could we see any judgement by other people, like the guards who could've looked at each other like 'What the hell?!'. \nOr when the Ogre takes Violet - there were some gasps in the crowd, but the audience doesn't get to see an outraged crowd (which would've made sense there) or any reaction at all besides Violet's and the King's. \nIt's similar with the sex-crazed king - there's no punishment for his behavior, except for sleeping with someone who's way too old and ugly for his liking. In traditional fairy tales (e.g. Grimm) he'd face some repercussions.\nThere are plenty of films out there that deal with flawed protagonists, but Hollywood movies usually put an emphasis on these flaws and put characters in situations where they clearly come to the surface and are dramatized. In Tale of Tales, they are just there and the story moves on.  \nAnd the ending is the same. It or rather they are short and don't wrap everything up. Yes, Violet gets crowned, but we don't know what's going on with Elias after his mother's death and if he'll meet Jonah again (probably, but it's not shown). And Dora is turning ugly again, but we don't get to see how this plays out or how the sisters react to each other's...changes (getting old and wrinkly again for Dora, getting flayed for Imma). \nI think there were lots of little things that contributed to this feeling. For instance, many characters didn't have names (unless I missed something). You have Elias, Jonah, Violet, Dora and Imma. And the virgin was called by name, I think. That's it, the rest aren't called anything (the necromancer) or simply 'King' or 'Queen'.\nSo it felt like the stories were told in a objective manner and the director showed us how it is, not what he what he wants us to see. \nAre there any more movies like that (preferably not a love-story)?\n", ["Incidentally also a fairy tale movie, but I feel like the 2009 Bluebeard movie (by Catherine Breillat) fits the bill quite well.", "I have to agree..

An instant classic. Go in with as little preconceptions as possible, just watch it right now basically. \n\nLA Confidential - spacey again, plus Russell Crowe, guy Pearce, Danny devito, Kim basinger and more. Roaring twenties intrigue / police corruption in booming California. \n\nChinatown - homage to film noire from the 70s. Jack Nicholson as a private eye who gets caught up in bigger events. One of the best final lines in movie history. Classic, but might feel slower / old fashioned to younger audiences. Must watch for any fan of the genre IMO. \n\nThe Maltese falcon - Humphrey bogart being awesome. Private eye movie that basically codifies the genre. Definitely not for everyone due to its age, but a fascinating look at what movies and gender roles were like. Razor sharp dialogue and too cool for school. \n\nHeat - overblown, overlong, reeking of excessive 90s-ness. De Niro, Pacino, Val Kilmer, Charlize Theron, Danny trejo, and more (including a breakout role for a young but clearly gifted Natalie Portman). Great performances all around, including a standout scene with deniro and Pacino in a coffee shop. Must watch at least once, if only for the famous downtown scene and to hear Pacino yell \"she's got a.... GREAT ASS\"\n\nThe French connection- oscar winning performance from gene Hackman (I think?). Features an incredible car chase sequence following an elevated train. Source of one of cinemas famous non-sequiturs, \"did you ever pick your feet in piquipsie?!\" (Spelling?). \n\nBullitt- Steve McQueen being a badass cop. Invented the San Francisco car chase trope. McQueen does all his own stunt driving. Legendary and a must watch for car chase fans. \n\nThe departed- a spy movie disguised as a cop movie (American remake of \"infernal affairs). Massive cast including dicaprio, Nicholson, Matt Damon, mark walberg, Alec\nBaldwin, Martin sheen, and more. Martin Scorsese at his finest- soundtrack, dialogue, cinematography all top notch. Mandatory viewing. \n\nThe Italian job- legendary heist movie. If you can't stomach the \"older movie vibe\" of the original featuring Michael Caine and more, you can watch the remake with walberg, Ed Norton, and more, but it should really be the original. Great ensemble performances in both. To be honest, worth watching the original then the remake to see how they updated, and to see the Mini Cooper chase sequence in original and new coopers. \n\nTakers- not a lot of love for this heist flick with Hayden Christiansen, idris Elba, T.I., Paul walker and more. Recycles / remixes / borrows from better movies that came before it (notably the Italian job) but aside from a noticably wooden performance from TI, the charisma of the actors together makes it an underrated an worthwhile watch IMO\n\nThe town- Ben affleck used properly. Great cast including some returnees from gone baby gone (notably the guy who finds the house for Casey affleck), as well as the guy who plays hawkeye, Pete postilwaithe (sp?) in one of his last performances. Sorry, I'm getting tired on mobile and names are starting to jumble but this is a surprisingly great flick, especially if you liked gone baby gone. \n\nRocknrolla- criminally underrated guy Ritchie film, IMO his best work. Idris Elba, Gerard butler, mark motherfuckin strong, tom hardy, thandie newton, and more in a Ritchie-esque tale of overlapping schemes, chance encounters, and strange twists in modern London's criminal scene. Rewards repeated viewing since the quick dialogue and thick accents pull no punches for us wankers in North America. Great soundtrack, acting, pacing, and cinematography. Must see. \n\nL4yer cake- smart British crime film about the drug industry , feels like guy Ritchie but isn't. Probably the movie that got Daniel Craig the bond role (look for the scene where he tries an iconic pose out!). Great ensemble cast and a killer soundtrack. Must see! \n\nUgh my arms are cramping on the phone. Hope this list helps a little! Quick shoutouts to other great movies \"reservoir dogs,\" \"pulp fiction\" (both Tarantino masterpieces), \"snatch\" \"lock stock and two smoking barrels\" and \"Sherlock Holmes\" (all three are more from guy Ritchie- sherlocks the easiest to understand if you have trouble win accents lol), \"Ronin\" (more of a spy / heist movie, basically built around two of the greatest car chases in modern cinema, de Niro, stellan skaarsgard, Jean Reno, Sean bean- must watch if you like car chases)\n\n\n Ninja edit: just realized I sort of missed the \"mystery\" part. Sorry. Usual Suspects is definitely your best bet for that, but a lot of these do have a kind of whodunit vibe and are great crime movies.
